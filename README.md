# CIS130_Resources
CIS130 Resources are a collection of resources, including a Geany syntax highlighting dotfile and a complete DosBox C drive.  This includes two versions of MASM, Turbo debugger, and some MASM documentation.  Also included is a DosBox config file that sets up the build system and should make DosBox look a little better on HDPI screens.  Users can clone or download this repo, drop the Dosbox config file in the proper directory, drop the Geany dotfile in the correct spot, and start writing ASM!
